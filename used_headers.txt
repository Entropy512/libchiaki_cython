These are the headers actually used by the Chiaki GUI/CLI and the files that use them:

CLI:
common.h 
log.h
discovery.h

GUI (Note - omitting things that are almost surely not useful like additional ffmpegdecoder instances):
From streamsession.h:
session.h
opusdecoder.h (we can almost surely not bother with this for a CLI, especially since we built the lib without Opus/ffmpeg/etc support)
ffmpegdecoder.h (again, we can drop this from a CLI-only binding)
pidecoder.h (again, we can drop this)
orientation.h (TBD, need to read this.  Probably is applicable to GUI only based on the name)

From discoverymanager.h:
discoveryservice.h (TBD, may be something we implement in python-native?)

From controllermanager.h:
controller.h (good chance we'll need this!  Also included from logsniffer.h)
orientation.h (OK, looks like we might need this, again, need to read through it and controllermanager)

From host.h:
regist.h (may be needed?)

From streamsession.cpp:
base64.h
session.h

From settingsdialog.h:
config.h (Read this to see what it's used for.  Probably disables things when building the GUI that were disabled at library build time, not applicable to us.)

From main.cpp:
session.h
regist.h
base64.h

From settings.cpp:
config.h
